Initially, we thought of making an circular arcade game that was like, light bulbs would glow one by one by in order and if a person is successful in stopping at different color one led bulb using pushbutton then he/she wins, but we failed in making it as we were not able to sink pushbutton with the rest of the setup.
 
The whole game was modified as 5 light bulbs will glow randomly if a person is able to guess the two correct he/she wins. 
This all we made under IETE society of TIET, Aryan Batra my fellow mate accompanied me in this project. and Sambhav Mehta our senior he saved us at the end by giving us the idea to modify the project in this way! This all was presented in the Society Fair 2024. 
Did soldering for the first time.
